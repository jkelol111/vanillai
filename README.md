# vanillai

*A vanilla HTML/CSS/JS app template for KaiOS, with 'native'-like UI.*

Inspired by KaiUI by nadim1992.

## Information

**TODO: insert screenshots**

This is a template in which you can develop your own KaiOS app on, no framework required. Just clone and change it up, or extend to your own needs. 

I created this after I completed the rewrite of [Kaidi Remote](https://github.com/jkelo1111/kaidi), from which I wrote my own custom stylesheet for the UI elements, partly inspired by the work done by [nadim1992's KaiUI project](https://github.com/nadim1992/KaiUI). This project is an extension of the custom stylesheets I created in Kaidi Remote's rewrite, bringing in more UI elements inspired from other UI toolkits such as [AdrianMachado's KaiUI project (For React framework)](https://github.com/AdrianMachado/KaiUI), as well as a JS library that helps in controlling various aspects of the UI, such as flipping between a light and dark theme, controlling the color of elements, etc.

As this is a personal project done in my free time, please do not expect much from it. I am not a designer nor a professional programmer, but I will try my best to complete what I can here, given the impending exams I have ahead of me, as well as life things. Consider this as some sort of pet project that I work at from time to time (hopefully one day my apps and yours can fully take advantage of this too).

To get started, go to the 'Get started' section now.

## Get started

It's easy as cloning/forking this project. Go to your favourite Git client or the command line and clone this repository to your desired location.

After that, if you want to check out the example app, use the KaiOS Simulator/WebIDE/gDeploy and load the `/example` up and deploy (there are many good guides on this on BananaHackers, go check the page out). You should see an app demonstrating all the UI elements you can use and how they look like.

The majority of the codebase has clear comments, so you will know what to do. So what are you waiting for? Create something great now!

## License

We have yet to decide a license for this project, because we're just starting out. We will add an appropiate license as needed.
